                <p>Smartphones, with their ability to connect to the internet, have transformed the way we access
information and communicate with others.<br> This connectivity is vital, enabling global interactions
and offering unmatched opportunities for today's communication and learning.</p>

                <br><p>Unlike traditional cell phones, smartphones are also portable but provide access to the internet,
enabling users to explore a wide range of apps on a single personal device (Vaterlaus et al.,
2021).<br> Beyond just being a tool for communication and information, this technology acts as a
bridge, keeping us connected to the outside world and showing the increasing need to be
connected at all times.<br> Interestingly, while many apps are designed for relaxation and social
interactions, it's noteworthy that a significant number of adolescents still value the
straightforward connection that even basic phones provide, highlighting the profound
importance they place on their social relationships (Vaterlaus et al., 2021; Karsay et al., 2019).<br>
This is further shown in this age group's dominant presence on social media, a space where
they find a sense of community, and real-time updates.<br> Research further emphasises this,suggesting that people with strong online friendships are often drawn to these platforms
because they feel a strong connection to the online community (Liubiniene, 2017).<br> Similarly, Jo
& Jang (2022) state that, many adolescents achieve a sense of well-being and address
emotional needs, such as their social confidence, by interacting on social media.</p>

                <br><p>Yet, itâ€™s worth noting that Gomez et al (2020) state that foster children and youth are the group
that can greatly benefit from careful technology use.<br> This article further explains that participants
in their research were pleased with the services and appreciated having smartphones.<br> These
devices allowed the youth to stay connected with family and friends. For many, especially those
in foster homes, having a smartphone was seen as a means of empowerment and connection.
It was widely believed that owning such a device provided the youth with autonomy in their
choices and decisions.</p>
