                <h2>Risk 1: 'FOMO' & Mental Health </h2>
                <p>TBuilding on what was mentioned earlier, smartphones become increasingly popular among
adolescents, and with social media use on the rise in this age group, a pressing concern has
emerged: the Fear of Missing Out, or ‘FOMO’.<br> This constant need to remain in the loop can
escalate anxiety and lead to feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, or depression.</p>
                <p>Smartphones offer a vast amount of information, making them more than just connection tools
to see what their peers are up to.<br> In conjunction with the internet and its wide reach, they also
serve a broader purpose, allowing users to convene information and feel more in control of their
surroundings (Casale et al., 2022).<br> Xiao et al (2023) and Casale et al (2022) both add to this by
closely associating FOMO to smartphone use among adolescents.<br> However, Xiao et al (2023)
further add that constantly checking their smartphones to see what they’re missing out on, can
further intensify their existing feelings of FOMO.<br> Both sources also elaborate on how the
increased feelings of FOMO can drive adolescents to use their smartphones as a coping
mechanism to alleviate their anxiety about missing out.<br> However, Xiao et al delve deeper into
this, suggesting that this can lead to a repetitive cycle, potentially spiraling into compulsive
smartphone use, which in turn, can have profound implications for their mental health - including
existing anxieties and loneliness.</p>

            <div class="risk">
                <h2>Risk 2: Stress, Anxiety & Depression</h2>
                <p>The risks associated with smartphone addiction, particularly its effects on the mental and
emotional health of adolescents, are notable.<br> Excessive and problematic smartphone usage can
harm interpersonal relationships and is linked with various psychological and behavioral issues,
including anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and suicidal thoughts (Yang et al., 2018).<br>
Additionally, reliance on smartphones can disrupt daily routines, alter personal relationships,
and negatively impact health and overall contentment (Yang et al., 2018).<br> Stress is suggested tobe a driving factor behind the overuse of smartphones, impacting cognitive and emotional
reactions.<br> The way individuals perceive stress influences their cognitive processes, causing
them to use smartphones as a form of stress relief Xiao et al (2023).<br> Furthermore, Yang et al
state that adolescents, due to their increased risk of impulsivity, might be more prone to
problematic smartphone use during stressful times.</p>
                <p>In contrast, Coyne et al (2018) discuss that during adolescence, consistent social media use
through smartphones is common, and usually doesn't hinder social development or functionality
into early adulthood. While smartphone overuse has its downsides, not all usage is harmful.<br>
Finding a balance between mindful use and its role in teen life is important.</p>
