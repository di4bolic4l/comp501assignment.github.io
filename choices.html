                <h2>Parental Monitoring vs Adolescent Autonomy in Smartphone Use</h2>
                <p>With the increasing use of smartphones and the internet, parents and guardians are faced with
the challenge of protecting their children from the risks associated with digital behaviors.<br> This
has raised the debate about parental control software and the extent to which parents should
monitor and limit smartphone use.<br> Bertrandias et al (2023) continue this by explaining that
parents have a responsibility to protect their children from potential harm, and that parental
control software can help parents monitor their children's online activity and limit access to
inappropriate content. While Bertrandias et al (2023) agree that adolescents have a right to
autonomy, Wallace (2021) states that closely watching adolescents can actually intensify their
challenging behaviors and that parental supervision, characterized by overly controlling
measures, can be harmful.<br> Overly invasive parental methods can compromise a teen's trust and
increase their anxiety, whereas granting them more freedom is linked to reduced depression.</p>

                <h2>Choice 2: How Excessive Smartphone Use Shapes Adolescents' Relationship</h2>
                <p>Higher smartphone use can weaken the bond between teenagers and their friends.<br> This can
impact their social growth and their skill in forming strong relationships, which are important
during the teenage years (Lim, 2022).<br> Establishing social relationships during an adolescent's
developmental stage helps them learn how to engage in appropriate behaviors in different social
environments and establish healthy relationships with different individuals (Lim, 2022).<br> Huang et
al (2022) also add to this by stating adolescents have more opportunities to share information
about themselves and spend more time with their friends, which benefits their social
relationships.<br> However, Lim (2022) contrasts this by explaining how excessive smartphone use
can lead to difficulties in learning these necessary social skills, hindering the ability to maintain
positive relationships with peers.<br> This can have a detrimental effect on life satisfaction through
negative relationships with peers. Therefore, it is important to monitor smartphone use among
adolescents and promote healthy social development through positive peer relationships.</p>
